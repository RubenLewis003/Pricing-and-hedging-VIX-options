Developed advanced quantitative models to price and hedge VIX derivatives:
- Calibrated an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process to 34 years of VIX data for short-term forecasting
- Designed convex optimisation frameworks for option portfolio allocation and indifference pricing using entropic risk measures
- Built and tested dynamic VIX futures trading strategies with time-distributed neural networks
- Evaluated practical limitations of machine learning–based trading strategies compared to static optimisation approaches
